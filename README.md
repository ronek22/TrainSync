# TrainSync
With this app you can synchronize workouts between:
* Strava -> Endomondo
* PolarFlow -> Endomondo

Always you can change your credentials, and you don't need to write them everytime. 

# Plans
 * Add multi-user support, that requires encrypting logins and passwords
 * Find way to not using Selenium, beacause it requires browser to run.
